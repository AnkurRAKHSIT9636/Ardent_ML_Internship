📧 Spam Email Detection Using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

Email spam detection is a critical application of machine learning that helps filter unwanted and potentially harmful messages.
This project focuses on building a Spam Email Detection system using machine learning classification algorithms to accurately classify emails as Spam or Not Spam (Ham) based on their content.

The model is trained on labeled email data and uses text processing techniques combined with a robust classifier to achieve high accuracy.

🎯 Objectives
	•	To preprocess and analyze email text data
	•	To convert text into numerical features using NLP techniques
	•	To build an efficient spam classification model
	•	To evaluate model performance using standard metrics

⸻

🧠 Machine Learning Approach
	•	Type: Supervised Learning (Text Classification)
	•	Target Classes:
	•	0 → Not Spam (Ham)
	•	1 → Spam

Commonly used algorithms for this task include:
	•	Naive Bayes
	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Random Forest / Support Vector Machine

These models are well-suited for text classification due to their efficiency and accuracy.
