🩺 Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning
📌 Overview

This project focuses on detecting breast cancer using machine learning techniques. By analyzing medical diagnostic data, the model classifies tumors as benign or malignant, helping demonstrate how data science and ML can support healthcare decision-making.

The implementation is done entirely in Python using popular data science libraries and is presented in a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and reproducibility.
