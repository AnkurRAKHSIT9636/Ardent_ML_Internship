🩺 Breast Cancer Detection Using Random Forest Classifier

📌 Project Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common and serious diseases affecting women worldwide. Early and accurate detection plays a crucial role in improving survival rates.
This project focuses on building a machine learning model using the Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant based on clinical features.

The model is trained and evaluated on a well-known breast cancer dataset and achieves high accuracy with robust performance.
