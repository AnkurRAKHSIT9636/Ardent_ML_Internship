💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

Credit card fraud is a major challenge in the financial sector, causing significant losses every year. Detecting fraudulent transactions quickly and accurately is essential to protect users and financial institutions.
This project implements a Credit Card Fraud Detection system using machine learning to classify transactions as Fraudulent or Legitimate based on transaction features.

The model is designed to handle highly imbalanced data, a common characteristic of fraud detection problems.

⸻

🎯 Objectives
	•	To analyze and preprocess transaction data
	•	To handle class imbalance effectively
	•	To build a reliable fraud detection model
	•	To evaluate performance using appropriate metrics

⸻

🧠 Machine Learning Approach
	•	Type: Supervised Learning (Binary Classification)
	•	Target Classes:
	•	0 → Legitimate Transaction
	•	1 → Fraudulent Transaction

Commonly used algorithms include:
	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Random Forest
	•	Decision Trees
	•	Gradient Boosting

These models are suitable for identifying complex patterns in transactional data.
